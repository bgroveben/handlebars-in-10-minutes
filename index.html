<!--
Block helpers are similar to regular helpers, but they have an opening and a closing tag like the #if
and #each built-in helpers.
These helpers can modify the HTML and content they are wrapped around.
They are a bit more complicated to create, but they are very powerful.
You can use them to reuse functionality or to create large blocks of HTML in a reusable way,
like making lists of items that you can use in many places in your app.

To create a block helper, you again use the Handlebars.registerHelper() function.
The difference is that this time we will use the second parameter of our callback function - options.
The options parameter exposes a few of the useful propreties that we will need.
The example below changes text into uppercase.

<script id="block-expressions-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">

  <p> The <b> {{#uppercase}} konami {{/uppercase}} </b> Code is a cheat code that appears in many video games.</p>

  <p>During the title screen before the game demo begins, the player could press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable the cheat:</p>

  <p>{{#uppercase}}{{code}}{{/uppercase}}</p>

  <p>The code is also present as an Easter egg on a number of websites.</p>
