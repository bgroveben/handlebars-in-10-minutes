<!-- Hey Ben, guess what? -->
<!-- Handlebars doesn't allow you to write JavaScript directly within templates.
     Instead, it gives you helpers.
     These are JavaScript functions that you can call from your templates, help you reuse code,
     and create complex templates.
     To call a helper, just use it as an expression - {{helpername}}.
     You can pass parameters as well -{{helpername 12345}}, which are passed as parameters to
     your helper function. -->
<!-- Now we're going to create a helper using the registerHelper function. -->
<!-- We're also going to use some of Handlebars' built-in helpers. -->
<script id="built-in-helpers-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  {{#each animals}}
    <p>
      The {{capitalize this.name}} says
      {{#if this.noise}}
        "{{this.noise}}".
      {{else}}
        nothing because it's a {{this.name}}.
      {{/if}}
    </p>
  {{/each}}
